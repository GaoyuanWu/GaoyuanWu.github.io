I am from Chengdu (成都), a city in southwest China. I love our dialects, our amazing food and of course, pandas! 

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of sports - soccer, badminton, tennis, and indoor rock clmbing. I love listening to music - I spend way too much time on Spotify (61349 minutes in 2024, RIP my ears). I am a proud top 1% listener of Wu Bai and Faye Wong, according to Spotify.
