Hi all! I am Gaoyuan Wu (吴高远), a Ph.D. student at Princeton University. I am currently working with Prof. [Maria Garlock](https://garlock.princeton.edu). My current research focuses on exploring new structural solutions (such as thin-shell structures) to coastal defense using numerical simulations. I am also interested in leveraging the high-performance computing (HPC) Python library [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) to boost structural shape optimization. Outside of the research world, I served as an [Residential Graduate Student](https://forbescollege.princeton.edu/people/residential-graduate-students-rgs) (RGS) at Forbes College for two years, from 2023 to 2025.

Before coming to Princeton, I spent 4 years in Shanghai at Tongji University, where I did my undergraduate studies in civil engineering with a focus in bridge engineering.

# Projects
## [JaxSSO](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO): A differentiable finite element analysis (FEA) solver for structural optimization, enabled by [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

### Features
* Automatic differentiation (AD): an easy and accurate way for gradient evaluation. The implementation of AD avoids deriving derivatives manually or trauncation errors from numerical differentiation.
* Acclerated linear algebra (XLA) and just-in-time compilation: these features in JAX boost the gradient evaluation
* Hardware acceleration: run on GPUs and TPUs for **faster** experience
* Support beam-column elements and MITC-4 quadrilateral shell elements
* Shape optimization, size optimization and topology optimization
* Seamless integration with machine learning (ML) libraries

Here is an implementation of JaxSSO to form-find a structure inspired by [Mannheim Multihalle](https://mannheim-multihalle.de/en/architecture/) using simple gradient descent. (First photo credit to Daniel Lukac)

## FEM solver of structural dynamics problem for 2D frame system

This is my final project for APC523 (Numerical Algorithms for Scientific Computing). It can be used for the following problems:
1. 2D-frame system under static loads.
1. 2D-frame system under dynamic loads (such as earthquake motions)

A comparison between the solver and commercial software SAP2000 is shown below, in which the nodal displacement from the solver matches well with SAP2000:
