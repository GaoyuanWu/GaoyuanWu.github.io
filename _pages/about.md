Hi y'all! I am Gaoyuan (Barry) Wu (吴高远), a Ph.D. student at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). I am currently working with Prof. [Maria Garlock](https://garlock.princeton.edu). My current research focuses on exploring new structural solutions (such as thin-shell structures) to coastal defense using numerical simulations. I am also interested in leveraging high-performance computing (HPC), accelerated linear algebra (XLA) and machine learning (ML) to boost structural shape optimization.

Before coming to Princeton, I spent 4 years in Shanghai at Tongji University, where I did my undergraduate studies in civil engineering with a focus in bridge engineering.

I am from [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) (成都), a city in southwest China. I love our dialects, our amazing food and of course, the PANDAS! 


What's New
=====
- Our new work *"A decoupled SPH-FEM analysis of hydrodynamic wave pressure on hyperbolic-paraboloid thin-shell coastal armor and corresponding structural response"* was accepted by *Engineering Structures* and is available online. Link [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2022.114738). **August, 2022**
- I presented our work *"A Study on the Hydrodynamic Response of Hypar Thin Shell Against Waves via a Decoupled SPH-FEM Analysis"* at Engineering Mechanics Institute ([EMI](https://www.emi-conference.org/)) conference in Baltimore, MD. **June, 2022**


# Small Projects
## FEM solver of structural dynamics problem for 2D frame system

This is my final project for APC523 (Numerical Algorithms for Scientific Computing). It can be used for the following problems:
1. 2D-frame system under static loads.
1. 2D-frame system under dynamic loads (such as earthquake motions)

A comparison between the solver and commercial software SAP2000 is shown below, in which the nodal displacement from the solver matches well with SAP2000:
