* This work studies the interaction between waves and Kinetic Umbrellas, a newly proposed structural solution for coastal hazard mitigation. A decoupled numerical scheme consisting of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) is illustrated and implemented to study the wave pressure and corresponding structural response. The results show that hypar thin shells are structurally feasible under surge and wave loadings, which can serve as a sustainable alternative to traditional coastal barriers that are uni-functional and structurally inefficient. The presented framework for studying wave-shell interaction can be generalized for various structural geometries.
